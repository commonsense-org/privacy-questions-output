## 1: Transparency

### 1.1: Policy Version

#### 1.1.1: Effective Date (BASIC)
Do the policies clearly indicate the version or effective date of the policies?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses the current version or effective date of the policies.
*   Citation
    *   California Online Privacy Protection Act: (An operator is required to provide notice of the effective or revision date of its privacy policy) See <a target="_blank" href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=8.&chapter=22.&lawCode=BPC">California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA), Cal. B.&P. Code §22575(b)(4)</a>
*   Background
    *   A vendor should provide an effective date and notice of change of the Privacy Policy. A vendor should describe how they will provide notice before making material changes to the Policy to the appropriate "account holder," that is, the school or district, parent, or eligible student. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 16</a>.

#### 1.1.2: Change Log 
Do the policies clearly indicate a changelog or past policy versions available are for review?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses a public archive or change log of previous policies.
*   Background
    *   This indicator seeks evidence that a company provides publicly available records of previous terms so that people can understand how the company’s terms have evolved overtime. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, F2, P2.</a>
    *   What is a changelog? A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project. Why keep a changelog? To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project. Who needs a changelog? People do. Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software are human beings who care about what's in the software. When the software changes, people want to know why and how.  See <a target="_blank" href="https:://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/">Keep a Changelog</a>

### 1.2: Policy Notice

#### 1.2.1: Change Notice 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not a user is notified if there are any material changes to the policies?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses notification will be provided to users about changes to the policies.
    *   Discloses commitment to notify users about changes to the privacy policy.
*   Citation
    *   California Online Privacy Protection Act: (An operator is required to describe the process by which they notify consumers who use or visit its website or online service of any material changes to its privacy policy) See <a target="_blank" href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=8.&chapter=22.&lawCode=BPC">California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA), Cal. B.&P. Code §22575(b)(3)</a>
*   Background
    *   It is common for companies to change their terms of service as their business evolves. However these changes can have a significant impact on how users can or cannot use the service, with potential impact on users’ freedom of expression rights. We therefore expect companies to commit to notify users when they change these terms and to provide users with information that helps them understand what these changes mean. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, F2, P2.</a>

#### 1.2.2: Method Notice 
Do the policies clearly indicate the method used to notify a user when policies are updated or materially change?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses how users will be directly notified of changes to the policies.
*   Citation
    *   California Online Privacy Protection Act: (An operator is required to describe the process by which they notify consumers who use or visit its website or online service of any material changes to its privacy policy) See <a target="_blank" href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=8.&chapter=22.&lawCode=BPC">California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA), Cal. B.&P. Code §22575(b)(3)</a>
*   Background
    *   The FTC adopts the OECD principle that companies should be accountable for their privacy practices. Specifically, the FTC calls on companies to implement procedures – such as designating a person responsible for privacy, training employees, and ensuring adequate oversight of third parties – to help ensure that they are implementing appropriate substantive privacy protections. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 24</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecd_privacy_framework.pdf">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Privacy Framework (2013)</a>.
    *   This indicator seeks clear disclosure by companies of the method and timeframe for notifying users about changes to their terms of service. We expect companies to commit to directly notify users prior to those changes coming into effect. The method of direct notification may differ according to the type of service. For services that contain user accounts, direct notification may involve sending an email or an SMS. For services that do not require a user account, direct notification may involve posting a prominent notice on the main page where users access the service. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, F2, P2.</a>

### 1.3: Policy Changes

B.&P. Code §22575(b)(3)</a>

#### 1.3.2: Effective Changes 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not any updates or material changes to the policies are effective immediately and continued use of the product indicates consent?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses changes to the polices become effective immediately.
*   Citation
    *   California Online Privacy Protection Act: (An operator is required to describe the process by which they notify consumers who use or visit its website or online service of any material changes to its privacy policy) See <a target="_blank" href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=8.&chapter=22.&lawCode=BPC">California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA), Cal. B.&P. Code §22575(b)(3)</a>
*   Background
    *   A school or district should maintain control of student data by preventing the vendor from changing its privacy policies without the school's or district's consent. A vendor that agrees to give notice of policy changes is good, however, a vendor that agrees not to change its policies without consent is better. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Model Terms of Service, p. 4.</a>

*   Background
    *   A vendor should provide a way for schools or districts, parents or legal guardians, and eligible students to contact them with questions or concerns about their privacy practices. Provide at a minimum an email address and consider providing a toll-free phone number as well. Develop and train staff in procedures for receiving and responding to privacy concerns.

*   Background
    *   The vendor's Privacy Policy should cover all student information, as well as the personally identifiable information of other users (parents, guardians, educators), acquired through the site or service. The Policy should be complete and comprehensive, and the vendor should consider a layered-notice format to highlight major elements.

*   Background
    *   FERPA defines the term personally identifiable information (PII) to include direct identifiers (such as a student's or other family member's name) and indirect identifiers (such as a student's date of birth, place of birth, or mother's maiden name). Indirect identifiers include metadata about a student's interaction with an application or service, and even aggregate information can be considered PII under FERPA if a reasonable person in the school community could identify individual students based on the indirect identifiers together with other reasonably available information, including other public information.

    *   The term “user information” appears in many indicators throughout the Privacy category. An expansive interpretation of user information is defined as: “any data that is connected to an identifiable person, or may be connected to such a person by combining datasets or utilizing data-mining techniques.” As further explanation, user information is any data that documents a user’s characteristics and/or activities. This information may or may not be tied to a specific user account. This information includes, but is not limited to, personal correspondence, user-generated content, account preferences and settings, log and access data, data about a user’s activities or preferences collected from third parties either through behavioral tracking or purchasing of data, and all forms of metadata.

*   Background
    *   Location information collected in the mobile context is considered a persistent identifier that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different websites or online services. Geolocation data includes information sufficient to identify the latitude and longitude coordinates of a user that can correspond to a specific street, address, name of a city or town. If location data is collected and shared with third-parties, companies should work to provide consumers with more prominent notice and choices about its geolocation data collection, transfer, use, and disposal practices.

    *   For mobile ecosystems, we expect companies to clearly disclose what options users have to control the collection of their location information. A user’s location changes frequently and many users carry their mobile devices nearly everywhere, making the collection of this type of information particularly sensitive. In addition, the location settings on mobile ecosystems can influence how other products and services access their location information. For instance, mobile apps may enable users to control location information. However, if the device on which those mobile apps run collects geolocation data by default and does not give users a way to turn this off, users may not be able to limit that mobile app's collection of their location information. For these reasons, we expect companies to disclose that users can control how their device interacts with their location information.

*   Background
    *   Biometric data are physical or behavioral characteristics which can be used to identify unique individuals. Biometric technologies measure these unique characteristics electronically and match them against existing records to create a highly accurate identity management system. Fingerprints, retnia scans, or voice and facial recognition are examples of physcial identification technologies. It uses the layout of facial features and their distance from one another for identification against a "gallery" of faces with similar characteristics. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/ibia_ntia_7-22-15_discussion_draft.pdf">Privacy Best Practice Recommendations For Commercial Biometric Use, NTIA Discussion Draft (July 22, 2015), p. 1</a>.
    *   The ability of facial recognition technology to identify consumers based solely on a photograph, create linkages between the offline and online world, and compile highly detailed dossiers of information, makes it especially important for companies using this technology to implement privacy by design concepts with robust choice and transparency policies. Such practices should include reducing the amount of time consumer information is retained, adopting reasonable security measures, and disclosing to consumers that the facial data collected may be used to link them to information from third-parties or publicly available sources.

*   Background
    *   The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), provides parents of students the right to access their children's Student Data or education records, and Students 18 years of age and older the right to access their own education records. In addition, FERPA provides the right to have the records amended, and the right to have some control over the disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) in the education records. Furthermore, strict storage guidelines surround Student Data which require organizations to maintain accurate, and up-to-date records. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1232g">20 U.S.C. § 1232g</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">34 C.F.R. Part 99.1</a>.
    *   What are Education Records? FERPA defines educational records as records that are: (1) directly related to a student; and (2) maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution. These records include, but are not limited to, transcripts, class lists, student course schedules, health records, student financial information, and student disciplinary records. It is important to note that any of these records maintained by a third-party acting on behalf of a school or district are also considered education records. <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1232g">20 U.S.C. § 1232g (a)(4)(A)</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">34 CFR § 99.3</a>; See <a target="_blank" href="https:://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/Vendor%20FAQ.pdf">PTAC, Responsibilities of Third-Party Service Providers under FERPA, p. 1</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, p. 2</a>.

Part 312.2</a>
*   Background
    *   The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires a privacy policy to list the kinds of personal information collected from children (for example, name, address, email address, hobbies, etc.), how the information is collected, and how the company uses the personal information. It also requires companies to indicate whether they disclose information collected from children to third-parties. If so, the company must also disclose the kinds of businesses in which the third-parties are engaged, the general purposes for which the information is used, and whether the third-parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality and security of the information. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-91">15 U.S.C. § 6502</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4939e77c77a1a1a08c1cbf905fc4b409&node=16:1.0.1.3.36&rgn=div5">16 C.F.R. Part 312</a>.
    *   If a company knows that a user of the online website or service is under the age of 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) will impose more stringent requirements on the collection of information from those users. COPPA requires that operators seeking to collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13, must first obtain verifiable parental consent. Even where a user is 13 or older, COPPA remains a source of best practices for companies that collect personal information from users, particularly when those users are still minors.

Part 312</a>.
    *   COPPA permits the collection of limited personal information from children under 13 for the purposes of: (1) Obtaining verified parental consent; (2) providing parents with a right to opt-out of an operator's use of a child's email address for multiple contacts of the child; and (3) to protect a child's safety on a website or online service.

See <a target="_blank" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Data protection by design and by default, Art. 25(1)</a>
*   Background
    *   Privacy principles are intended to work together to shift the burden for protecting privacy away from consumers and to encourage companies to make strong privacy protections the default. Reasonable collection limits and data disposal policies work in tandem with streamlined notices and improved consumer choice mechanisms. Together, they function to provide substantive protections by placing reasonable limits on the collection, use, and retention of consumer data to more closely align with consumer expectations, while also raising consumer awareness about the nature and extent of data collection, use, and third-party sharing, and the choices available to them. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 24</a>.
    *   Companies should limit data collection to that which is consistent with the context of a particular transaction or the consumer's relationship with the business, or as required or specifically authorized by law. For any data collection that is inconsistent with these contexts, companies should make appropriate disclosures to consumers at a relevant time and in a prominent manner – outside of a privacy policy or other legal document. This clarification of the collection limitation principle is intended to help companies assess whether their data collection is consistent with what a consumer might expect, but if it is not, they should provide prominent notice and choice. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 27</a>.
    *   Data Minimization is a privacy principle best practice that requires companies to limit the data they collect and retain, and dispose of it once they no longer need it. This best practice is reinforced by the FTC which encourages companies to collect only the data they need to accomplish a specific business purpose, which is generally supported by several privacy frameworks and federal privacy statutes and regulations such as FERPA, COPPA, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecd_privacy_framework.pdf">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Privacy Framework (2013)</a>; See <a target="_blank" href="http:://publications.apec.org/publication-detail.php?pub_id=390">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Framework</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-staff-report-november-2013-workshop-entitled-internet-things-privacy/150127iotrpt.pdf">FTC, Internet of Things, Privacy and Security in a Connected World (2015), p. 24</a>.
    *   A vendor should practice data minimization and collect only the student information necessary to accomplish the school purposes their site or service is designed to achieve or as directed by the school or district. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 12</a>.
    *   We expect companies to commit to the principle of data minimization and to demonstrate how this principle shapes their practices regarding user information. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, P3.</a>

*   Background
    *   Online educational services increasingly collect a large amount of contextual or transactional data as part of their operations, often referred to as "metadata." Metadata refer to information that provides meaning and context to other data being collected; for example, information about how long a particular student took to perform an online task has more meaning if the user knows the date and time when the student completed the activity, how many attempts the student made, and how long the student's mouse hovered over an item (potentially indicating indecision). See <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, pp. 2-3</a>.
    *   Metadata that have been stripped of all direct and indirect identifiers are not considered protected information under FERPA, because the data are not PII. A provider that has been granted access to PII from education records under the "school official" exception may use any metadata that are not linked to FERPA-protected information for other purposes, unless otherwise prohibited by the terms of their agreement with the school or district. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, pp. 2-3</a>.
    *   Companies collect a wide range of personal information from users—from personal details and account profiles to a user’s activities and location. Companies also often share this information with third parties, such as advertisers, governments, and legal authorities. We expect companies to clearly disclose what user information they share and with whom. Company disclosure should specify if it shares user information with governments and with commercial entities. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, P4.</a>

#### 3.1.2: Data Categories (BASIC)
Do the policies clearly indicate what categories of information are shared with third parties?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses the categories of information shared with third parties.
*   Citation
    *   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act: (A parent or guardian can request the operator to provide a description of the specific types or categories of personal information collected from children by the application or service) See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4939e77c77a1a1a08c1cbf905fc4b409&node=16:1.0.1.3.36&rgn=div5">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), 16 C.F.R. Part 312.6(a)(1)</a>
*   Background
    *   Consumers deserve more transparency about how their data is shared beyond the entities with which they do business directly, including "third-party" data collectors. This means ensuring that consumers are meaningfully aware of the spectrum of information collection and reuse as the number of firms that are involved in mediating their consumer experience or collecting information from them multiplies. The data services industry should follow the lead of the online advertising and credit industries and build a common website or online portal that lists companies, describes their data practices, and provides methods for consumers to better control how their information is collected and used or to opt-out of certain marketing uses. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf">Exec. Office of the President, Big Data: Seizing Opportunities, Preserving Values (2014), p. 62</a>.
    *   What is the "School Official" Exception? In some cases, providers need PII from a students's education records in order to deliver the agreed-upon services. FERPA's school official exception to consent is most likely to apply to the schools' and districts' relationships with service providers. When schools and districts outsource institutional services or functions, FERPA permits the disclosure of PII from education records to contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third-parties provided that the outside party meets specified requirements. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">34 C.F.R. § 99.31(a)(1)(i)</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/Vendor%20FAQ.pdf">PTAC, Responsibilities of Third-Party Service Providers under FERPA, P. 2</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, p. 3-5</a>.

*   Background
    *   Data while not traditionally considered personally identifiable, can be linkable to a consumer or device. Studies have demonstrated that consumers object to being tracked, regardless of whether the tracker explicitly learns a consumer name. There also exists the potential for harm, such as discriminatory pricing based on online browsing history, even without the use of PII.

*   Background
    *   The FTC agrees that the defintion of first-party marketing should include the practice of contacting consumers across different channels. Regardless of the particular means of contact, receipt of a message from a company with which a consumer has interacted directly is likely to be consistent with the consumer's relationship with that company. If an offline or online retailer tracks a customer's activities on a third-party website, this is unlikely to be consistent with the customer's relationship with the retailer; thus, choice should be required.

    *   Social network log-on or Federated login (using a Google, Facebook, or other account to log-into multiple sites) can lead to unintended data disclosure between these web sites. Companies' privacy policies should clearly indicate what data, if any, they collect from the login provider and also what data they share back to the login provider. While these plugins or shared logins are useful and can potentially improve security by reducing the number of usernames and passwords, they can also leak sensitive personal information between third-parties.

*   Background
    *   There is nothing wrong with a provider using de-identified data for other purposes, because privacy statutes, govern PII, not de-identified data. But because it can be difficult to fully de-identify data, as a best practice, an agreement between a company and third-party should prohibit re-identification and any future data transfers unless the third-party also agrees not to attempt re-identification. It is also a best practice to be specific about the de-identification process. De-identification typically requires more than just removing any obvious individual identifiers, as other demographic or contextual information can often be used to re-identify specific individuals. Retaining location and school information can also greatly increase the risk of re-identification. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/TOS_Guidance_Jan%202015_0.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Model Terms of Service, P. 3</a>.
    *   Properly de-identified data can reduce the risk of a person's sensitive personal information being disclosed, but data de-identification must be done carefully. Simple removal of direct identifiers from the data to be released does not constitute adequate de-identification. Properly performed de-identification involves removing or obscuring all identifiable information until all data that can lead to individual identification have been expunged or masked. Further, when making a determination as to whether the data have been sufficiently de-identified, it is necessary to take into consideration cumulative re-identification risk from all previous data releases and other reasonably available information. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/data_deidentification_terms.pdf">PTC, Data De-identification: An Overview of Basic Terms, p. 3</a>.
    *   FERPA allows properly de-identified data to be used for other purposes, though providers planning to use de-identified student data should be clear about their methodologies for de-identification. If de-identified data will be transferred to another party, it is a best practice to contractually prohibit the third-party from attempting to re-identify any student data. Providers should also acknowledge whether anonymized metadata—a type of deidentified or partially de-identified data—will be used, and for what purposes. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/Vendor%20FAQ.pdf">PTAC, Responsibilities of Third-Party Service Providers under FERPA, P. 3.</a>
    *   If a vendor shares covered information for the development and improvement of educational sites or services, they should de-identify and aggregate the information first.

*   Background
    *   While data shared in the aggregate can reduce the risk of re-identifying anonymous individuals, it does not completely eliminate the risk, and sharing of aggregate data should be carefully reviewed. The aggregation of student-level data into school-level (or higher) reports removes much of the risk of disclosure, since no direct identifiers (such as a name, Social Security Number, or student ID) are present in the aggregated tables. Some risk of disclosure does remain, however, in circumstances where one or more students possess a unique or uncommon characteristic (or a combination of characteristics) that would allow them to be identified in the data table (this commonly occurs with small ethnic subgroup populations), or where some easily observable characteristic corresponds to an unrelated category in the data table (e.g., if a school reports that 100% of males in grade 11 scored at "Below Proficient" on an assessment). In these cases, some level of disclosure avoidance is necessary to prevent disclosure in the aggregate data table. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/FAQs_disclosure_avoidance.pdf">PTAC, Frequently Asked Questions—Disclosure Avoidance (Oct 2012), p. 2</a>.

    *   A company must take reasonable measures to ensure that the data is de-identified. This means that the company must achieve a reasonable level of justified confidence that the data cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular consumer, computer, or other device. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 21.</a>
    *   Anonymous data is 'data that is in no way connected to another piece of information that could enable a user to be identified.' This expansive view is necessary to reflect several facts. First, skilled analysts can de-anonymize large data sets. This renders nearly all promises of anonymization unattainable. In essence, any data tied to an 'anonymous identifier' is not anonymous; rather, this is often pseudonymous data that may be tied back to the user’s offline identity. Second, metadata maybe as or more revealing of a user's associations and interests than content data, thus this data is of vital interest. Third, entities that have access to many sources of data, such as data brokers and governments, may be able to pair two or more data sources to reveal information about users. Thus, sophisticated actors can use data that seems anonymous to construct a larger picture of a user.

*   Background
    *   A company that transfers data from one company to another should not place emphasis on the disclosures themselves, but on whether a disclosure leads to a use of personal data that is inconsistent within the context of its collection or a consumer's expressed desire to control the data. Thus, if a company transfers personal data to a third party, it remains accountable and thus should hold the recipient accountable—through contracts or other legally enforceable instruments.

    *   A company's data would not be "reasonably linkable" to a particular consumer or device to the extent that the company implements three significant protections for that data: (1) a given data set is not reasonably identifiable, (2) the company publicly commits not to re-identify it, and (3) the company requires any downstream users of the data to keep it in de-identified form.

    *   The ability to re-identify "anonymous" data supports the FTC's framework application to data that can be reasonably linked to a consumer or device, because consumers' privacy interest in data goes beyond what is strictly labeled PII. There exists a legitimate interest for consumers in having control over how companies collect and use aggregated or de-identified data, browser fingerprints, and other types of non-PII.

Include a requirement that any service providers notify the vendor immediately of any unauthorized disclosure of the student information in their custody, and then act promptly to provide proper notice as required by law. Make clear to service providers that they may separately face liability for the mishandling of student data.

Part 312.8</a>
*   Background
    *   When data are collected in one context and combined with data from other sources or different contexts, it increases the potential for an individual's privacy to be compromised. Combining data from multiple sources is part of the process of creating a digital profile of a student. Combining data from multiple sources can also be used to re-identify data sets that have been de-identified, or to identify individuals within data sets that have been shared as anonymous aggregated data. A privacy policy that prohibits third-parties from re-identifying anonymous aggregated data provides an additional level of privacy protection for users. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/data_deidentification_terms.pdf">PTC, Data De-identification: An Overview of Basic Terms</a>.
    *   The FTC recommends that third-party data brokers take reasonable precautions to ensure that downstream users of their data do not use it for eligibility determinations or for unlawful discriminatory purposes. Of course, the use of race, color, religion, and certain other categories to make credit, insurance, and employment decisions is already against the law, but data brokers should help ensure that the information does not unintentionally go to unscrupulous entities that would be likely to use it for unlawful discriminatory purposes. Similarly, data brokers should conduct due diligence to ensure that data that they intend for marketing or risk mitigation purposes is not used to deny consumers credit, insurance, employment, or the like. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/data-brokers-call-transparency-accountability-report-federal-trade-commission-may-2014/140527databrokerreport.pdf">FTC, Data Brokers: A Call For Transparency and Accountability (May 2014), pp. 55-56</a>.

    *   The FTC's framework application applies to data that, while not yet linked to a particular consumer, computer, or device, may reasonably become so. There is significant evidence demonstrating that technological advances and the ability to combine disparate pieces of data can lead to identification of a consumer, computer, or device even if the individual pieces of data do not constitute PII.

#### 4.1.2: Data Purpose 
Do the policies clearly indicate the context or purpose for which data are collected?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses why user information is collected for the product.
    *   Discloses the context in which user information is collected for the product.
*   Citation
    *   General Data Protection Regulation: (Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information: ...

*   Background
    *   The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") encourages companies that collect personal information that is inconsistent with the context of a particular transaction, or the consumer's relationship with the business, to make appropriate disclosures to consumers regarding the company's data collection practices at a relevant time and in a prominent manner – outside of a privacy policy or other legal document. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 27</a>.
    *   There may be practices that are inconsistent with the context of the interaction standard and thus warrant consumer choice. For instance, there may be contexts in which the "repurposing" of data to improve existing products or services would exceed the internal operations concept. Thus, where a product improvement involves additional sharing of consumer data with third-parties, it would no longer be an "internal operation" consistent with the context of the consumer's interaction with a company. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 39</a>.

#### 4.2.1: Combination Type 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the vendor would treat personally identifiable information (PII) combined with non-personally identifiable information as PII?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses any collected information combined with personal information is treated as Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
*   Citation
    *   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act: (Non-personal information collected from a child that is later combined with personally identifiable information of that child, obtained from either the vendor or third party becomes PII) See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4939e77c77a1a1a08c1cbf905fc4b409&node=16:1.0.1.3.36&rgn=div5">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), 16 C.F.R. Part 312.2</a>
*   Background
    *   When data are collected in one context and combined with data from other sources or different contexts, it increases the potential for an individual's privacy to be compromised. Combining data from multiple sources is part of the process of creating a digital profile of a student. Combining data from multiple sources can also be used to re-identify data sets that have been de-identified, or to identify individuals within data sets that have been shared as anonymous aggregated data. A privacy policy that prohibits third-parties from re-identifying anonymous aggregated data provides an additional level of privacy protection for users. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/data_deidentification_terms.pdf">PTC, Data De-identification: An Overview of Basic Terms</a>.

### 4.4: Data Changes

#### 4.4.1: Context Consent 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the vendor will obtain consent if the practices in which data are collected change or are inconsistent with contractual requirements?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses consent will be obtained if the context in which data are collected or used changes.
*   Citation
    *   General Data Protection Regulation: (Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take into account, several factors.)

*   Indicator
    *   Discloses what type of user content or activities are prohibited on the product.
    *   Discloses clear examples to help the user understand what the rules are and how they are enforced.
    *   Discloses violations of the rules may result in the restriction or termination of a user's account.
    *   Discloses what mechanisms are used to identity accounts that violate the rules.
    *   Discloses an appeal process is available to reinstate accounts alleged to have violated the rules.
*   Background
    *   We therefore expect companies to clearly disclose what these rules are and how companies enforce them. This includes information about how companies learn of material or activities that violate their terms.

See <a target="_blank" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Conditions for Consent, Art. 7(2)</a>
*   Background
    *   Establishing consumer choice as a baseline requirement for companies that collect and use consumer data, while also identifying certain practices where choice is unnecessary, is an appropriately balanced model. It increases consumers' control over the collection and use of their data, preserves the ability of companies to innovate new products and services, and sets clear expectations for consumers and industry alike. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 36</a>.
    *   There are five categories of data practices that companies can engage in without offering consumer choice, because they involve data collection and use that is either obvious from the context of the transaction or sufficiently accepted or necessary for public policy reasons. The categories include: (1) product and service fulfillment; (2) internal operations; (3) fraud prevention; (4) legal compliance and public purpose; and (5) first-party marketing. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 36</a>.
    *   Companies should recognize the sensitivity of data and take special care to delete data as soon as possible and implement reasonable restrictions on the retention of data and dispose of it once the data has outlived the legitimate purpose for which it was collected. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), pp. 28-29</a>.
    *   The Administration encourages companies engaged in online advertising to refrain from collecting, using, or disclosing personal data that may be used to make decisions regarding employment, credit, and insurance eligibility or similar matters that may have significant adverse consequences to consumers. Collecting data for such sensitive uses is at odds with the contextually well-defined purposes of generating revenue and providing consumers with ads that they are more likely to find relevant.

### 5.3: Remedy Process

#### 5.3.1: Complaint Notice 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the vendor has a grievance or remedy mechanism for users to file a complaint after the vendor restricts or removes a user's content or account?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses notification is provided to users if their account or content is restricted.
    *   Discloses notification is provided to users who attempt to access content that has been restricted.
    *   Discloses users can file a complaint if their account or content is restricted.

*   Background
    *   Companies often set boundaries for what content users can post on a service as well as what activities users can engage in on the service. Companies can also restrict a user’s account, meaning that the user is unable to access the service, for violating these rules. For mobile ecosystems, this can include restricting access to an end-user’s account or a developer’s account. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, F3.</a>
    *   We also expect companies to clearly disclose whether they have a policy of granting priority or expedited consideration to any government authorities and/or members of private organizations or other entities that identify their organizational affiliation when they report content or users for allegedly violating the company’s rules. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, F3.</a>
    *   This indicator focuses on whether companies clearly disclose that they notify users when they take these types of actions (whether due to terms of service enforcement or third-party restriction requests). A company's decision to restrict or remove access to content or accounts can have a significant impact on users' freedom of expression and access to information rights. We therefore expect companies to disclose that they notify users when they have removed content, restricted a user's account, or otherwise restricted users' abilities to access a service. If a company removes content that a user has posted, we expect the company to inform that user about its decision. If a different user attempts to access content that the company has restricted, we expect the company to notify that user about the content restriction. We also expect companies to specify reasons for their decisions. This disclosure should be part of companies' explanations of their content and access restriction practices. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, F8.</a>

### 5.4: Data Settings

#### 5.4.1: User Control 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not a user can control the vendor or third party's use of their information through privacy settings?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses how users can control the collection, use, or disclosure of their information.
*   Background
    *   While notice and consent remains fundamental in many contexts, it is important to examine whether a greater focus on how data is used and reused would be a more productive basis for managing privacy rights in a big data environment. It may be that creating mechanisms for individuals to participate in the use and distribution of his or her information after it is collected is actually a better and more empowering way to allow people to access the benefits that derive from their information. Privacy protections must also evolve in a way that accommodates the social good that can come of big data use.

*   Background
    *   FERPA guarantees parents the right to access their child's education records, including those maintained by providers on behalf of the school or district, upon request within 45 days; while some states provide a shorter window. As a best practice, parental access to their child's education records should be seamless, with providers giving the requested records to the school or district, who can confirm the parent's identity and provide them access to the records. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/Vendor%20FAQ.pdf">PTAC, Responsibilities of Third-Party Service Providers under FERPA, p. 4</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">34 C.F.R.

    *   The use of inaccurate personal data may lead to a range of harms. The risk of these harms, in addition to the scale, scope, and sensitivity of personal data that a company retains, help to determine what kinds of access and correction facilities may be reasonable in a given context. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo24557/privacy-final.pdf">Exec. Office of the President, Consumer Data Privacy in a Networked World: A Framework for Protecting Privacy and Promoting Innovation in the Global Digital Economy (2012), p. 20</a>.
    *   A vendor should implement policies and procedures to allow parents, legal guardians, or eligible students to correct errors in their covered information acquired or maintained through your site or service.

*   Background
    *   A vendor should retain student information acquired through the site or service only as long as allowed or required by the school or district. A vendor should also describe their data retention policy, including how long they retain student information and why. A vendor's default retention period for covered information should not be indefinite. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 12</a>.
    *   Companies collect a wide range of personal information from users in exchange for the use of and access to the company's products and services. This information can range from personal details, profiles, and account activities to information about a user's activities and location. We expect companies to clearly disclose how long they retain user information and the extent to which they remove identifiers from user information they retain. Users should also be able to understand what happens when they delete their accounts. Companies that choose to retain user information for extended periods of time should take steps to ensure that data is not tied to a specific user. Acknowledging the ongoing debates about the efficacy of de-identification processes, and the growing sophistication around re-identification practices, we still consider de-identification a positive step that companies can take to protect the privacy of their users. If companies collect multiple types of information, we expect them to provide detail on how they handle each type of information.

We therefore expect companies to clearly disclose whether users have the option to delete specific types of user information.

## 8: Security

### 8.1: User Identity

#### 8.1.1: Verify Identity 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the vendor or vendor-authorized third party verifies a user's identity with personal information?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses users are required to verify their identity with a government issued identification or with other forms of identification that could be connected to their offline identity.
    *   Discloses users are required to verify their identity with personal information for parental consent purposes.
*   Citation
    *   Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act: (An educational institution is required to use reasonable methods to verify the identity of a parent of a child with whom they disclose information) See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 34 C.F.R.

See <a target="_blank" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Conditions Applicable to Child's Consent in Relation to Information Society Services, Art. 8(2)</a>
    *   General Data Protection Regulation: (Where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request ... the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.)

*   Background
    *   The ability to communicate anonymously is essential to freedom of expression both on and offline. The use of a real name online, or requiring users to provide a company with identifying information, provides a link between online activities and a specific person. This presents human rights risks to those who, for example, voice opinions that don't align with a government's views or who engage in activism that a government does not permit. It also presents risks for people who are persecuted for religious beliefs or sexual orientation. We therefore expect companies to disclose whether they might ask users to verify their identities using government-issued ID or other forms of identification that could be connected to their offline identity. We acknowledge that users may have to provide information that could be connected to their offline identity in order to access paid features of various products and services. However, users should be able to access features that don't require payment without needing to provide information that can be tied to their offline identity.

*   Background
    *   A vendor should provide a general description of the technical, administrative and physical safeguards you use to protect student information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 14</a>.
    *   A vendor should implement and maintain reasonable security measures appropriate to the nature of the student information, including covered information, acquired through your site or service. Designate and train someone responsible and use a risk management process: identify your data assets, assess threats and vulnerabilities, apply appropriate controls, monitor their effectiveness, and repeat the process. As discussed in the California Data Breach Report, the Center for Internet Security’s Critical Security Controls is a good starting point for high-priority security controls. The Federal Trade Commission’s Start with Security also offers helpful guidance.

*   Background
    *   Encryption is an important tool for protecting freedom of expression and privacy. The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression has stated unequivocally that encryption and anonymity are essential for the exercise and protection of human rights. We expect companies to clearly disclose that user communications are encrypted by default, that transmissions are protected by “perfect forward secrecy,” that users have an option users have to turn on end-to-end encryption, and if the company offers end-to-end encryption by default. For mobile ecosystems, we expect companies to clearly disclose that they enable full-disk encryption.

### 8.7: Data Breach

#### 8.7.1: Breach Notice (BASIC)
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the vendor provides notice in the event of a data breach to affected individuals?

See <a target="_blank" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject, Art. 34(3)(a)-(c)</a>
*   Background
    *   The breach notification laws in California and the 46 other states are similar in many ways, because most are modeled on the original California law. All of them require notifying individuals when their personal information has been breached, prefer written notification but allow using the "substitute method" in certain situations, allow for a law enforcement delay, and provide an exemption from the requirement to notify when data is encrypted and the keys required to de-crypt the data are still secure. However, there are some differences, primarily in three areas: (1) the notification trigger, (2) the timing for notification, and (3) the definition of covered information. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/breachreport2016">CA DOJ, California Data Breach Report (2016)</a>.
    *   A vendor should develop and describe the process for notifying schools or school districts, parents, legal guardians, or eligible students, as well as any appropriate government agencies, of any unauthorized disclosure of student information. Determine whether the incident and the types of data involved also require notification under California's breach notification law, and if so, take appropriate action. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 15</a>.
    *   When the security of users' data has been compromised due to a data breach, companies should have clearly disclosed processes in place for addressing the security threat and for notifying affected users. Given that data breaches can result in significant threats to an individual's financial or personal security, in addition to exposing private information, companies should make these security processes publicly available. Individuals can then make informed decisions and consider the potential risks before signing up for a service or giving a company their information. Company press releases or blog posts addressing a data breach after it has occurred do not qualify as sufficient disclosure for this indicator. We expect companies to have formal policies in place regarding their handling of data breaches if and when they occur, and companies to make this information about these policies and commitments public. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, P15.</a>

### 8.8: Data Oversight

#### 8.8.1: Security Audit 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the data privacy or security practices of the vendor are internally or externally audited to ensure compliance?

See <a target="_blank" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Security of processing, Art. 32(1)(d)</a>
*   Background
    *   Companies have access to immense amounts of information about users and should take the highest possible measures to keep this information secure. Just as companies should clearly disclose their oversight processes related to freedom of expression and privacy, they should also provide information about their oversight processes for keeping user information secure. We therefore expect companies to clearly disclose that they have systems in place to limit and monitor employee access to user information. We also expect the company to clearly disclose that it deploys both internal and external security teams to conduct security audits on its products and services.

*   Background
    *   Companies hold significant amounts of user information, making them targets for malicious actors. We expect companies to help users protect themselves against such risks. This can include materials on how to set up advanced account authentication; adjust privacy settings; avoid malware, phishing, and social engineering attacks; avoid third-party tracking; avoid or address bullying or harassment online; and what “safe browsing” means. Companies should present this guidance to the public using clear language, ideally paired with visual images, designed to help users understand the nature of the risks companies and users can face. These can include tips, tutorials, how-to guides, or other resources and should be presented in a way that users can easily understand (for instance with visuals, graphics, bullet points, and lists).

*   Background
    *   Online behavioral or targeted advertising is the practice of collecting information about consumers' online interests in order to deliver targeted advertising to them. This system of advertising revolves around ad networks that can track individual consumers—or at least their devices—across different websites. When organized according to unique identifiers, this data can provide a potentially wide-ranging view of individual use of the Internet. These individual behavioral profiles allow advertisers to target ads based on inferences about individual interests, as revealed by Internet use. Targeted ads are generally more valuable and efficient than purely contextual ads and provide revenue that supports an array of free online content and services. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo24557/privacy-final.pdf">Exec. Office of the President, Consumer Data Privacy in a Networked World: A Framework for Protecting Privacy and Promoting Innovation in the Global Digital Economy (2012), pp. 11-12</a>.
    *   The FTC recommends that affirmative express consent is appropriate when a company uses sensitive data for any marketing, whether first or third-party. When health or children's information is involved, for example, the likelihood that data misuse could lead to embarrassment, discrimination, or other harms is increased. This risk exists regardless of whether the entity collecting and using the data is a first-party or a third-party that is unknown to the consumer. In light of the heightened privacy risks associated with sensitive data, first parties should provide a consumer choice mechanism at the time of data collection. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 47</a>.
    *   The FTC believes affirmative express consent for first-party marketing using sensitive data should be limited. Certainly, where a company's business model is designed to target consumers based on sensitive data – including data about children, financial and health information, Social Security numbers, and certain geolocation data – the company should seek affirmative express consent before collecting the data from those consumers. On the other hand, the risks to consumers may not justify the potential burdens on general audience businesses that incidentally collect and use sensitive information. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), pp. 47-48</a>.
    *   If a vendor displays targeted advertising they should not use any information, including covered information and persistent unique identifiers, acquired through the site or service as a basis for targeting advertising to a specific student or other user. This includes both advertising delivered on the site or service that acquired the information and advertising delivered on any other site or service based on that information.

*   Background
    *   The FTC recommends that where a company that has a first-party relationship with a consumer for delivery of a specific service, but also tracks the consumer's activities across other parties' websites, such tracking is unlikely to be consistent with the context of the consumer's first-party relationship with the entity. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 41</a>.
    *   The FTC agrees that the defintion of first-party marketing should include the practice of contacting consumers across different channels. Regardless of the particular means of contact, receipt of a message from a company with which a consumer has interacted directly is likely to be consistent with the consumer's relationship with that company. If an offline or online retailer tracks a customer's activities on a third-party website, this is unlikely to be consistent with the customer's relationship with the retailer; thus, choice should be required.

*   Background
    *   Companies should improve the transparency of their advertising practices by disclosing that they engage in data enhancement and educate consumers about the practice, identifying the third-party sources of the data, and providing a link or other contact information so the consumer can contact the third-party source directly.

    *   The FTC recommends that to further protect consumer privacy, first-parties that obtain marketing data for enhancement should take steps to encourage their third-party data broker sources to increase their own transparency, including by participating in a centralized data broker website, where consumers could learn more information about data brokers and exercise choice.

*   Background
    *   Advertising to children in school presents a variety of legal issues. Several states have laws that place restrictions on the advertising of products or services that have inappropriate content for children, such as alcohol and firearms. Additionally, contextual advertising would likely be permissible as, 'support for internal operations' of a service or applciation, in contrast to behaviorally targeted advertising that implicates several privacy laws such as the CIPA, COPPA, and FERPA, which restrict the use of personal information without parental consent.
    *   The FTC restricts advertisements that may be misleading to children. Advertising to children under the age of 13 is particularly scrutinized, as research shows that these children are especially vulnerable because they are unable to understand an advertisement's persuasive intent. Self-regulatory guidelines are also published by the Children's Advertising Review Unit, which is a branch of the advertising self-regulatory program administered by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The guidelines generally provide that any advertising to young children should be clearly distinguishable from the other content.

    *   Third-party data brokers should implement better measures to refrain from collecting information from children and teens, particularly in marketing products. As to children under 13, COPPA already requires certain online services to refrain from collecting personal information from this age group without parental consent. The principles underlying COPPA could apply equally to information collected offline from children. As to teens, the FTC previously has noted that they often lack the judgment to appreciate the long-term consequences of, for example, posting personal information on the Internet.

Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the vendor responds to a "Do Not Track" signal or other opt-out mechanisms from a user?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses the company responds to 'Do Not Track' requests.
*   Citation
    *   California Online Privacy Protection Act: (An operator is required to disclose how they respond to Web browser "Do Not Track" signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to opt-out of the collection of personally identifiable information about their online activities over time and across third-party Web sites) See <a target="_blank" href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=8.&chapter=22.&lawCode=BPC">California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA), Cal. B.&P. Code §22575(b)(5)</a>
*   Background
    *   A Do Not Track system should be implemented universally to cover all parties that would track consumers. The choice mechanism should be easy to find, easy to understand, and easy to use. Any choices offered should be persistent and should not be overridden if, for example, consumers clear their cookies or update their browsers. A Do Not Track system should be comprehensive, effective, and enforceable. It should opt consumers out of behavioral tracking through any means and not permit technical loopholes. Finally, an effective Do Not Track system should go beyond simply opting consumers out of receiving targeted advertisements; it should opt them out of collection of behavioral data for all purposes other than those that would be consistent with the context of the interaction (e.g., preventing click-fraud or collecting de-identified data for analytics purposes). See <a target="_blank" href="http:://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&division=8.&title=&part=&chapter=22.&article=">California Business and Professions Code §§ 22575(b)(5)-(6)</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 53</a>.
    *   Even as we focus more on data use, consumers still have a valid interest in "Do Not Track" tools that help them control when and how their data is collected. Strengthening these tools is especially important because there is now a growing array of technologies available for recording individual actions, behavior, and location data across a range of services and devices. Public surveys indicate a clear and overwhelming demand for these tools, and the government and private sector must continue working to evolve privacy-enhancing technologies in step with improved consumer services. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf">Exec. Office of the President, Big Data: Seizing Opportunities, Preserving Values (2014), p. 62</a>.
    *   One prominent user-generated signal is the “Do Not Track” standard. Also known by the acronym “DNT,” this refers to a setting in a user’s browser preferences which tells entities not to “track” them. In other words, every time a user loads a website, any parties that are involved in delivering the page (of which there are often many, primarily advertisers) are told not to collector store any information about the user’s visit to the page. However, this is merely a polite request—a company may ignore a DNT request, and many do.

*   Background
    *   The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires an operator to post a link to a notice of its information practices on the homepage of its web site or online service and in each area of its web site where it collects "Personal Information" from children. An operator of a general audience web site with a separate children's area must also post a link to its privacy policy on the homepage of the children's area.

Part 312</a>
    *   COPPA applies anytime an operator of a website or online service has actual knowledge that it is collects, maintains, uses, or discloses personal information from a child under 13. In these situations an operator is generally required to obtain verified parental consent.
    *   COPPA requires companies to establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information collected from children. Companies should minimize what they collect in the first place and take reasonable steps to release personal information only to service providers and third-parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality, security, and integrity. Always obtain assurances that third-parties will live up to their contractual privacy responsibilities. Also, companies should hold on to personal information only as long as is reasonably necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. They should securely dispose of it once they no longer have a legitimate reason for retaining it.

*   Background
    *   An operator may satisfy its obligations under COPPA by participating in a safe harbor program. The safe harbor programs are self-regulatory frameworks developed by industry groups and approved by the FTC. FTC-approved COPPA safe harbor programs offer parental notification and consent systems for operators who are members of their programs. In addition, the FTC recognizes that these and other common consent mechanisms could benefit operators (especially smaller ones) and parents if they offer a proper means for providing notice and obtaining verifiable parental consent, as well as ongoing controls for parents to manage their children's accounts.  The FTC recommends operators use a common consent mechanism to assist in providing notice and obtaining consent, because they are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the notice accurately and completely reflects their information collection practices and that the consent mechanism is reasonably designed to reach the parent.

*   Background
    *   FERPA is a Federal law that protects personally identifiable information in students' education records from unauthorized disclosure. It affords parents the right to access their child's education records, the right to seek to have the records amended, and the right to have some control over the disclosure of personally identifiable information from the education records. When a student turns 18 or enters a postsecondary institution at any age, the rights under FERPA transfer from the parents to the student ("eligible student"). <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1232g">20 U.S.C. § 1232g</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">34 C.F.R.

    *   FERPA denies federal funding to educational agencies or institutions that have a practice or policy of permitting the release of student information without parental consent. There is an exception where such information is released to "school officials" who have been determined by the educational agency or institution to have a legitimate educational interest.
    *   A vendor should describe the procedures for a parent, legal guardian, or eligible student to review and correct covered information.

*   Background
    *   What is the "School Official" Exception? In some cases, providers need PII from a students's education records in order to deliver the agreed-upon services. FERPA's school official exception to consent is most likely to apply to the schools' and districts' relationships with service providers. When schools and districts outsource institutional services or functions, FERPA permits the disclosure of PII from education records to contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third-parties provided that the outside party meets specified requirements. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">34 C.F.R. § 99.31(a)(1)(i)</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/Vendor%20FAQ.pdf">PTAC, Responsibilities of Third-Party Service Providers under FERPA, P. 2</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, p. 3-5</a>.
    *   Any PII from students' education records that the provider receives under FERPA's school official exception may only be used for the specific purpose for which it was disclosed (i.e., to perform the outsourced institutional service or function, and the school or district must have direct control over the use and maintenance of the PII by the provider receiving the PII). Further, under FERPA's school official exception, the provider may not share or sell FERPA-protected information, or re-use it for any other purposes, except as directed by the school or district and as permitted by FERPA.

#### 11.3.9: Directory Information 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the vendor discloses student information as 'Directory Information' under a FERPA exception?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses student information can be shared without parental consent as Directory Information.
    *   Discloses what type of student information can be shared as Directory Information under a FERPA exception.
*   Citation
    *   Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act: (An operator may disclose a student's "Directory Information" if the operator provides notice to parents of the type of information that is designated as "directory," and gives notice of a parent's right to refuse disclosure and to opt-out) See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 34 C.F.R. Part 99.3; 34 C.F.R. Part 99.37</a>
*   Background
    *   What is the "Directory Information" Exception? An exception to parental consent that permits the disclosure of PII from education records under FERPA. Information designated by the school or district as directory information may be disclosed without consent and used without restriction in conformity with the policy, unless the parent, guardian, or eligible student opts out. Examples of directory information about students include name, address, telephone number, email address, date and place of birth, grade level, sports participation, and honors or awards received. Before a school or district can disclose directory information, it must first provide public notice to parents and eligible students of the types of information designated as directory information, the intended uses for the information, and the right of parents or eligible students to "opt out" of having their information shared. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/Vendor%20FAQ.pdf">PTAC, Responsibilities of Third-Party Service Providers under FERPA, p. 3</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, pp. 3-4</a>.

#### 11.3.10: School Consent 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not responsibility or liability for obtaining verified parental consent is transferred to the school or district?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses the obligation to obtain verifiable parental consent from a parent of guardian are transferred to the school or district.
    *   Discloses the school or district are required to provide verifiable parental consent records to the company upon request.
*   Background
    *   Where a school has contracted with an operator to collect personal information from students for the use and benefit of the school, and for no other commercial purpose, the operator is not required to obtain consent directly from parents, and can presume that the school’s authorization for the collection of students’ personal information is based upon the school having obtained the parents’ consent . . . As a best practice, the school should consider providing parents with a notice of the websites and online services whose collection it has consented to on behalf of the parent. Schools can identify, for example, sites and services that have been approved for use district-wide or for the particular school. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions">FTC, Complying with COPPA: Frequently Asked Questions, M. COPPA AND SCHOOLS, 2-4.</a>.

### 11.4: Legal Requirements

#### 11.4.1: Policy Jurisdiction 
Do the policies clearly indicate the vendor's jurisdiction that applies to the construction, interpretation, and enforcement of the policies?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses the domestic or foreign jurisdiction that applies to the enforcement of the policies.
*   Background
    *   A court’s general authority to hear and/or “adjudicate” a legal matter is referred to as its “jurisdiction.” In the United States, jurisdiction is granted to a court or court system by statute or by constitution. A court is competent to hear and decide only those cases whose subject matter fits within the court’s jurisdiction. A legal decision made by a court that did not have proper jurisdiction is deemed void and nonbinding upon the litigants. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://courts.uslegal.com/state-courts-and-procedures/the-concept-of-jurisdiction/">The Concept Of Jurisdiction</a>.

#### 11.4.2: Dispute Resolution 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the vendor requires a user to waive the right to a jury trial, or settle any disputes by Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses the requirement that users must waive the right to a jury trial.
    *   Discloses the requirement that users must settle any disputes by Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
*   Background
    *   The vendor's policies should describe the legal process used to determine how disputes will be resolved. Any dispute arising out of an alleged breach of the policies will likely be settled by Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) through binding arbitration before judicial arbitration or mediation services, such as the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service.
    *   ADR allows parties to save time and money (compared to litigation), decide their own procedures during the mediation or arbitration, prevent setting precedent/lawmaking (if desired), and, in mediation, allows more inventive solutions.  ADR, however, provides more opportunities for arbitors and mediators to be biased, less extensive discovery periods, lack of a right to appeal the decision, and an increased chance of no solution (which ultimately leads to litigation). See <a target="_blank" href="https:://apps.americanbar.org/buslaw/blt/8-4adr.html">ADR: A Litigator's Perspective</a>.

#### 11.4.3: Class Waiver 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the vendor requires the user to waive their right to join a class action lawsuit?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses the requirement that users must waive any rights to join a class action lawsuit.
*   Background
    *   A class action is a lawsuit filed on behalf of a group, or 'class,' of individuals with similar legal claims. A plaintiff, or small group of named plaintiffs (plaintiffs whose names appear on the face of the legal filings), submits a lawsuit representing a larger group of plaintiffs (of which the potential size may be several thousands of individuals) who are unnamed. The unnamed plaintiffs are identified as members of a class by virtue of a shared legal grievance with the named plaintiff(s) . . . Class actions provide a means through which plaintiffs may bring small legal claims that would be too costly to litigate individually. Additionally, class actions can equalize the difference in power between robust entities and individuals without significant resources . . . While the size of a class provides strength to its members, it also limits their choices and options. Unnamed plaintiffs (those who chose not to opt-out), have the least amount of control over the case . . [T]he complexity of class action cases makes them difficult and expensive to litigate, requiring greater time and resources of the attorneys and the court. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/class-actions/">Justia</a>.

#### 11.4.4: Law Enforcement 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the vendor can use or disclose a user's data under a requirement of applicable law to comply with a legal process, to respond to governmental requests, to enforce their own policies, for assistance in fraud detection and prevention, or to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of the vendor, its users, or others?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses user information may be shared with government or legal authorities.
    *   Discloses processes for responding to government or legal requests.
    *   Discloses processes for responding to private requests.
    *   Discloses its process for responding to court orders.
    *   Discloses its process for responding to requests from foreign jurisdictions.
    *   Discloses explanations that include the legal basis under which it may comply with government or private requests.
    *   Discloses the company carries out due diligence on government or private requests before deciding how to respond.
    *   Discloses the company's commitment to push back on inappropriate or overbroad requests made by government or private requests.
    *   Discloses clear guidance or examples of implementation of its process of responding to government or private requests.

*   Background
    *   Disclosure of personal information for the "internal operations" of the website or online service, means activities necessary for the site or service to maintain or analyze its functioning; perform network communications; authenticate users or personalize content; serve contextual advertising or cap the frequency of advertising; protect the security or integrity of the user, website, or online service; ensure legal or regulatory compliance; or fulfill a request of a child. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4939e77c77a1a1a08c1cbf905fc4b409&node=16:1.0.1.3.36&rgn=div5">16 C.F.R. 312.2</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions">FTC, Complying with COPPA: Frequently Asked Questions, q. 5</a>.
    *   A vendor should only disclose covered information acquired through the site or service to ensure legal compliance, respond to judicial process, or protect an individual's safety or the security of the site or service. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 14</a>.
    *   Companies often receive requests to remove, filter, or restrict access to content and accounts. These requests can come from government agencies or courts (both domestic and foreign), as well as from private entities (i.e. non-governmental and non-judicial entities). We expect companies to publicly disclose their process for responding to requests from governments and courts, as well as to private requests that come through some type of defined or organized process. Private requests can come through a process established by law,(e.g., requests made under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the European Right to beForgotten ruling, etc.) or a self-regulatory arrangement (e.g., company agreements to block certain types of images). This indicator evaluates whether the company clearly discloses how it responds to government and private requests to remove, filter, or restrict content or accounts. The company should disclose the legal reasons why it would remove content. In some cases, the law might prevent a company from disclosing information referenced in this indicator’s elements. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, F5.</a>

### 11.5: Certification

#### 11.5.1: Privacy Badge 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the vendor has signed any privacy pledges or received any other privacy certifications?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses commitment to a third-party privacy certification, badge, award, or principles of a privacy pledge.
*   Citation
    *   General Data Protection Regulation: (Adherence to approved codes of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller.) See <a target="_blank" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Responsibility of the Controller, Art. 24(3)</a>
*   Background
    *   Privacy protection depends on companies being accountable to consumers as well as to agencies that enforce consumer data privacy protections. However, compliance goes beyond external accountability to encompass practices through which companies prevent lapses in their privacy commitments or detect and remedy any lapses that may occur. Companies that can demonstrate that they live up to their privacy commitments have powerful means of maintaining and strengthening consumer trust. A company's own evaluation can prove invaluable to this process. The appropriate evaluation technique, which could be a self-assessment and need not necessarily be a full audit, will depend on the size, complexity, and nature of a company's business, as well as the sensitivity of the data involved. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo24557/privacy-final.pdf">Exec.

### 11.6: International Laws

#### 11.6.1: GDPR Jurisdiction 
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not a user's data are subject to International data transfer or jurisdiction laws, such as a privacy shield or a safe harbor framework that protects the cross-border transfer of a user's data?
