    *   General Data Protection Regulation: (“personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person) See <a target="_blank" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Definitions, Art. 4(1)</a>
*   Background
    *   FERPA defines the term personally identifiable information (PII) to include direct identifiers (such as a student's or other family member's name) and indirect identifiers (such as a student's date of birth, place of birth, or mother's maiden name). Indirect identifiers include metadata about a student's interaction with an application or service, and even aggregate information can be considered PII under FERPA if a reasonable person in the school community could identify individual students based on the indirect identifiers together with other reasonably available information, including other public information.

    *   The term “user information” appears in many indicators throughout the Privacy category. An expansive interpretation of user information is defined as: “any data that is connected to an identifiable person, or may be connected to such a person by combining datasets or utilizing data-mining techniques.” As further explanation, user information is any data that documents a user’s characteristics and/or activities. This information may or may not be tied to a specific user account. This information includes, but is not limited to, personal correspondence, user-generated content, account preferences and settings, log and access data, data about a user’s activities or preferences collected from third parties either through behavioral tracking or purchasing of data, and all forms of metadata.

    *   General Data Protection Regulation: (Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects.) See <a target="_blank" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Data protection by design and by default, Art. 25(1)</a>
*   Background
    *   Privacy principles are intended to work together to shift the burden for protecting privacy away from consumers and to encourage companies to make strong privacy protections the default. Reasonable collection limits and data disposal policies work in tandem with streamlined notices and improved consumer choice mechanisms. Together, they function to provide substantive protections by placing reasonable limits on the collection, use, and retention of consumer data to more closely align with consumer expectations, while also raising consumer awareness about the nature and extent of data collection, use, and third-party sharing, and the choices available to them. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 24</a>.
    *   Companies should limit data collection to that which is consistent with the context of a particular transaction or the consumer's relationship with the business, or as required or specifically authorized by law. For any data collection that is inconsistent with these contexts, companies should make appropriate disclosures to consumers at a relevant time and in a prominent manner – outside of a privacy policy or other legal document. This clarification of the collection limitation principle is intended to help companies assess whether their data collection is consistent with what a consumer might expect, but if it is not, they should provide prominent notice and choice. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 27</a>.
    *   Data Minimization is a privacy principle best practice that requires companies to limit the data they collect and retain, and dispose of it once they no longer need it. This best practice is reinforced by the FTC which encourages companies to collect only the data they need to accomplish a specific business purpose, which is generally supported by several privacy frameworks and federal privacy statutes and regulations such as FERPA, COPPA, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecd_privacy_framework.pdf">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Privacy Framework (2013)</a>; See <a target="_blank" href="http:://publications.apec.org/publication-detail.php?pub_id=390">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Framework</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-staff-report-november-2013-workshop-entitled-internet-things-privacy/150127iotrpt.pdf">FTC, Internet of Things, Privacy and Security in a Connected World (2015), p. 24</a>.
    *   A vendor should practice data minimization and collect only the student information necessary to accomplish the school purposes their site or service is designed to achieve or as directed by the school or district.

D.O.J., p. 12</a>.
    *   We expect companies to commit to the principle of data minimization and to demonstrate how this principle shapes their practices regarding user information. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, P3.</a>

*   Background
    *   Online educational services increasingly collect a large amount of contextual or transactional data as part of their operations, often referred to as "metadata." Metadata refer to information that provides meaning and context to other data being collected; for example, information about how long a particular student took to perform an online task has more meaning if the user knows the date and time when the student completed the activity, how many attempts the student made, and how long the student's mouse hovered over an item (potentially indicating indecision). See <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, pp. 2-3</a>.
    *   Metadata that have been stripped of all direct and indirect identifiers are not considered protected information under FERPA, because the data are not PII. A provider that has been granted access to PII from education records under the "school official" exception may use any metadata that are not linked to FERPA-protected information for other purposes, unless otherwise prohibited by the terms of their agreement with the school or district. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, pp. 2-3</a>.
    *   Companies collect a wide range of personal information from users—from personal details and account profiles to a user’s activities and location. Companies also often share this information with third parties, such as advertisers, governments, and legal authorities. We expect companies to clearly disclose what user information they share and with whom. Company disclosure should specify if it shares user information with governments and with commercial entities. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, P4.</a>

#### 3.1.2: Data Categories (BASIC)
Do the policies clearly indicate what categories of information are shared with third parties?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses the categories of information shared with third parties.
*   Citation
    *   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act: (A parent or guardian can request the operator to provide a description of the specific types or categories of personal information collected from children by the application or service) See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4939e77c77a1a1a08c1cbf905fc4b409&node=16:1.0.1.3.36&rgn=div5">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), 16 C.F.R. Part 312.6(a)(1)</a>
*   Background
    *   Consumers deserve more transparency about how their data is shared beyond the entities with which they do business directly, including "third-party" data collectors. This means ensuring that consumers are meaningfully aware of the spectrum of information collection and reuse as the number of firms that are involved in mediating their consumer experience or collecting information from them multiplies. The data services industry should follow the lead of the online advertising and credit industries and build a common website or online portal that lists companies, describes their data practices, and provides methods for consumers to better control how their information is collected and used or to opt-out of certain marketing uses. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf">Exec. Office of the President, Big Data: Seizing Opportunities, Preserving Values (2014), p. 62</a>.
    *   What is the "School Official" Exception? In some cases, providers need PII from a students's education records in order to deliver the agreed-upon services. FERPA's school official exception to consent is most likely to apply to the schools' and districts' relationships with service providers. When schools and districts outsource institutional services or functions, FERPA permits the disclosure of PII from education records to contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third-parties provided that the outside party meets specified requirements. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">34 C.F.R. § 99.31(a)(1)(i)</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/Vendor%20FAQ.pdf">PTAC, Responsibilities of Third-Party Service Providers under FERPA, P. 2</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, p. 3-5</a>.

B.&P. Code §§ 22580-22582</a>
*   Background
    *   The FTC agrees that the defintion of first-party marketing should include the practice of contacting consumers across different channels. Regardless of the particular means of contact, receipt of a message from a company with which a consumer has interacted directly is likely to be consistent with the consumer's relationship with that company. If an offline or online retailer tracks a customer's activities on a third-party website, this is unlikely to be consistent with the customer's relationship with the retailer; thus, choice should be required.

*   Background
    *   Companies that have first-party relationships with consumers should disclose specifically the purposes for which they provide personal data to third-parties, in order to help consumers understand the nature of those third-parties' activities, and whether those third-parties are bound to limit their use of the data to achieving those purposes. This gives consumers a more tractable task of assessing whether to engage with a single entity, rather than trying to understand what personal data third-parties (potentially dozens, or even hundreds of entities) receive and how they use it.

*   Background
    *   A company that transfers data from one company to another should not place emphasis on the disclosures themselves, but on whether a disclosure leads to a use of personal data that is inconsistent within the context of its collection or a consumer's expressed desire to control the data. Thus, if a company transfers personal data to a third party, it remains accountable and thus should hold the recipient accountable—through contracts or other legally enforceable instruments. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo24557/privacy-final.pdf">Exec. Office of the President, Consumer Data Privacy in a Networked World: A Framework for Protecting Privacy and Promoting Innovation in the Global Digital Economy (2012), p. 22</a>.
    *   A company's data would not be "reasonably linkable" to a particular consumer or device to the extent that the company implements three significant protections for that data: (1) a given data set is not reasonably identifiable, (2) the company publicly commits not to re-identify it, and (3) the company requires any downstream users of the data to keep it in de-identified form. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 21</a>.
    *   The ability to re-identify "anonymous" data supports the FTC's framework application to data that can be reasonably linked to a consumer or device, because consumers' privacy interest in data goes beyond what is strictly labeled PII. There exists a legitimate interest for consumers in having control over how companies collect and use aggregated or de-identified data, browser fingerprints, and other types of non-PII. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), pp. 18-19</a>.
    *   Properly de-identified data can reduce the risk of a person's sensitive personal information being disclosed, but data de-identification must be done carefully. Simple removal of direct identifiers from the data to be released does not constitute adequate de-identification. Properly performed de-identification involves removing or obscuring all identifiable information until all data that can lead to individual identification have been expunged or masked. Further, when making a determination as to whether the data have been sufficiently de-identified, it is necessary to take into consideration cumulative re-identification risk from all previous data releases and other reasonably available information. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/data_deidentification_terms.pdf">PTC, Data De-identification: An Overview of Basic Terms, p. 3</a>.
    *   A vendor should contractually require their service providers who receive covered information acquired through the site or service to use the information only to provide the contracted service, not to further disclose the information, to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices as required by law, and to return or delete covered information at the completion of the contract. Include a requirement that any service providers notify the vendor immediately of any unauthorized disclosure of the student information in their custody, and then act promptly to provide proper notice as required by law. Make clear to service providers that they may separately face liability for the mishandling of student data.

*   Background
    *   A vendor should provide a general description of the technical, administrative and physical safeguards you use to protect student information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 14</a>.
    *   A vendor should implement and maintain reasonable security measures appropriate to the nature of the student information, including covered information, acquired through your site or service. Designate and train someone responsible and use a risk management process: identify your data assets, assess threats and vulnerabilities, apply appropriate controls, monitor their effectiveness, and repeat the process. As discussed in the California Data Breach Report, the Center for Internet Security’s Critical Security Controls is a good starting point for high-priority security controls. The Federal Trade Commission’s Start with Security also offers helpful guidance. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA.

    *   This indicator is applicable to internet and mobile ecosystem companies. Companies hold significant amounts of user information, making them targets for malicious actors. We expect companies to help users protect themselves against such threats. Companies should clearly disclose that they use advanced authentication techniques to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and information. We also expect companies to provide users with tools that enable them to secure their accounts and to know when their accounts maybe compromised.

*   Background
    *   The breach notification laws in California and the 46 other states are similar in many ways, because most are modeled on the original California law. All of them require notifying individuals when their personal information has been breached, prefer written notification but allow using the "substitute method" in certain situations, allow for a law enforcement delay, and provide an exemption from the requirement to notify when data is encrypted and the keys required to de-crypt the data are still secure. However, there are some differences, primarily in three areas: (1) the notification trigger, (2) the timing for notification, and (3) the definition of covered information. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/breachreport2016">CA DOJ, California Data Breach Report (2016)</a>.
    *   A vendor should develop and describe the process for notifying schools or school districts, parents, legal guardians, or eligible students, as well as any appropriate government agencies, of any unauthorized disclosure of student information. Determine whether the incident and the types of data involved also require notification under California's breach notification law, and if so, take appropriate action. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 15</a>.
    *   When the security of users' data has been compromised due to a data breach, companies should have clearly disclosed processes in place for addressing the security threat and for notifying affected users. Given that data breaches can result in significant threats to an individual's financial or personal security, in addition to exposing private information, companies should make these security processes publicly available. Individuals can then make informed decisions and consider the potential risks before signing up for a service or giving a company their information. Company press releases or blog posts addressing a data breach after it has occurred do not qualify as sufficient disclosure for this indicator. We expect companies to have formal policies in place regarding their handling of data breaches if and when they occur, and companies to make this information about these policies and commitments public.

*   Background
    *   Online behavioral or targeted advertising is the practice of collecting information about consumers' online interests in order to deliver targeted advertising to them. This system of advertising revolves around ad networks that can track individual consumers—or at least their devices—across different websites. When organized according to unique identifiers, this data can provide a potentially wide-ranging view of individual use of the Internet. These individual behavioral profiles allow advertisers to target ads based on inferences about individual interests, as revealed by Internet use. Targeted ads are generally more valuable and efficient than purely contextual ads and provide revenue that supports an array of free online content and services. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo24557/privacy-final.pdf">Exec. Office of the President, Consumer Data Privacy in a Networked World: A Framework for Protecting Privacy and Promoting Innovation in the Global Digital Economy (2012), pp. 11-12</a>.
    *   The FTC recommends that affirmative express consent is appropriate when a company uses sensitive data for any marketing, whether first or third-party. When health or children's information is involved, for example, the likelihood that data misuse could lead to embarrassment, discrimination, or other harms is increased. This risk exists regardless of whether the entity collecting and using the data is a first-party or a third-party that is unknown to the consumer. In light of the heightened privacy risks associated with sensitive data, first parties should provide a consumer choice mechanism at the time of data collection. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 47</a>.
    *   The FTC believes affirmative express consent for first-party marketing using sensitive data should be limited. Certainly, where a company's business model is designed to target consumers based on sensitive data – including data about children, financial and health information, Social Security numbers, and certain geolocation data – the company should seek affirmative express consent before collecting the data from those consumers. On the other hand, the risks to consumers may not justify the potential burdens on general audience businesses that incidentally collect and use sensitive information.

    *   If a vendor displays targeted advertising they should not use any information, including covered information and persistent unique identifiers, acquired through the site or service as a basis for targeting advertising to a specific student or other user. This includes both advertising delivered on the site or service that acquired the information and advertising delivered on any other site or service based on that information.

*   Background
    *   The FTC recommends that where a company that has a first-party relationship with a consumer for delivery of a specific service, but also tracks the consumer's activities across other parties' websites, such tracking is unlikely to be consistent with the context of the consumer's first-party relationship with the entity. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 41</a>.
    *   The FTC agrees that the defintion of first-party marketing should include the practice of contacting consumers across different channels. Regardless of the particular means of contact, receipt of a message from a company with which a consumer has interacted directly is likely to be consistent with the consumer's relationship with that company. If an offline or online retailer tracks a customer's activities on a third-party website, this is unlikely to be consistent with the customer's relationship with the retailer; thus, choice should be required.

*   Background
    *   Companies should improve the transparency of their advertising practices by disclosing that they engage in data enhancement and educate consumers about the practice, identifying the third-party sources of the data, and providing a link or other contact information so the consumer can contact the third-party source directly. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 44</a>.
    *   The FTC recommends that to further protect consumer privacy, first-parties that obtain marketing data for enhancement should take steps to encourage their third-party data broker sources to increase their own transparency, including by participating in a centralized data broker website, where consumers could learn more information about data brokers and exercise choice. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 44</a>.
    *   Companies' privacy policies should be clear that collected data and/or metadata may not be used to create user profiles for the purposes of targeting students or their parents for advertising and marketing, which could violate several privacy laws. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/TOS_Guidance_Jan%202015_0.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Model Terms of Service, p. 4</a>.
    *   As students begin to share information with educational institutions or vendors, they expect that they are doing so in order to develop knowledge and skills, not to have their data used to build extensive profiles about their strengths and weaknesses that could be used to their disadvantage in later years. Educational institutions are also in a unique position to help prepare children, adolescents, and adults to grapple with the world of big data.
