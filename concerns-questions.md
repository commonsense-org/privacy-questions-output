*   Background
    *   FERPA defines the term personally identifiable information (PII) to include direct identifiers (such as a student's or other family member's name) and indirect identifiers (such as a student's date of birth, place of birth, or mother's maiden name). Indirect identifiers include metadata about a student's interaction with an application or service, and even aggregate information can be considered PII under FERPA if a reasonable person in the school community could identify individual students based on the indirect identifiers together with other reasonably available information, including other public information.

    *   Companies collect a wide range of personal information from users—from personal details and account profiles to a user’s activities and location. We expect companies to clearly disclose what user information they collect and how they do so. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, P3.</a>
    *   The term “user information” appears in many indicators throughout the Privacy category. An expansive interpretation of user information is defined as: “any data that is connected to an identifiable person, or may be connected to such a person by combining datasets or utilizing data-mining techniques.” As further explanation, user information is any data that documents a user’s characteristics and/or activities. This information may or may not be tied to a specific user account. This information includes, but is not limited to, personal correspondence, user-generated content, account preferences and settings, log and access data, data about a user’s activities or preferences collected from third parties either through behavioral tracking or purchasing of data, and all forms of metadata.

See <a target="_blank" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Data protection by design and by default, Art. 25(1)</a>
*   Background
    *   Privacy principles are intended to work together to shift the burden for protecting privacy away from consumers and to encourage companies to make strong privacy protections the default. Reasonable collection limits and data disposal policies work in tandem with streamlined notices and improved consumer choice mechanisms. Together, they function to provide substantive protections by placing reasonable limits on the collection, use, and retention of consumer data to more closely align with consumer expectations, while also raising consumer awareness about the nature and extent of data collection, use, and third-party sharing, and the choices available to them. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 24</a>.
    *   Companies should limit data collection to that which is consistent with the context of a particular transaction or the consumer's relationship with the business, or as required or specifically authorized by law. For any data collection that is inconsistent with these contexts, companies should make appropriate disclosures to consumers at a relevant time and in a prominent manner – outside of a privacy policy or other legal document. This clarification of the collection limitation principle is intended to help companies assess whether their data collection is consistent with what a consumer might expect, but if it is not, they should provide prominent notice and choice. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 27</a>.
    *   Data Minimization is a privacy principle best practice that requires companies to limit the data they collect and retain, and dispose of it once they no longer need it. This best practice is reinforced by the FTC which encourages companies to collect only the data they need to accomplish a specific business purpose, which is generally supported by several privacy frameworks and federal privacy statutes and regulations such as FERPA, COPPA, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecd_privacy_framework.pdf">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Privacy Framework (2013)</a>; See <a target="_blank" href="http:://publications.apec.org/publication-detail.php?pub_id=390">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Framework</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-staff-report-november-2013-workshop-entitled-internet-things-privacy/150127iotrpt.pdf">FTC, Internet of Things, Privacy and Security in a Connected World (2015), p. 24</a>.
    *   A vendor should practice data minimization and collect only the student information necessary to accomplish the school purposes their site or service is designed to achieve or as directed by the school or district. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 12</a>.
    *   We expect companies to commit to the principle of data minimization and to demonstrate how this principle shapes their practices regarding user information. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, P3.</a>

#### 2.1.3: Geolocation Data

*   Background
    *   Location information collected in the mobile context is considered a persistent identifier that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different websites or online services. Geolocation data includes information sufficient to identify the latitude and longitude coordinates of a user that can correspond to a specific street, address, name of a city or town. If location data is collected and shared with third-parties, companies should work to provide consumers with more prominent notice and choices about its geolocation data collection, transfer, use, and disposal practices. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 33</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/10-1259">U.S. v. Jones, 132 S. Ct. 945, 955 (2012)</a>("GPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person's public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations").
    *   For mobile ecosystems, we expect companies to clearly disclose what options users have to control the collection of their location information. A user’s location changes frequently and many users carry their mobile devices nearly everywhere, making the collection of this type of information particularly sensitive. In addition, the location settings on mobile ecosystems can influence how other products and services access their location information. For instance, mobile apps may enable users to control location information. However, if the device on which those mobile apps run collects geolocation data by default and does not give users a way to turn this off, users may not be able to limit that mobile app's collection of their location information. For these reasons, we expect companies to disclose that users can control how their device interacts with their location information.

*   Background
    *   Biometric data are physical or behavioral characteristics which can be used to identify unique individuals. Biometric technologies measure these unique characteristics electronically and match them against existing records to create a highly accurate identity management system. Fingerprints, retnia scans, or voice and facial recognition are examples of physcial identification technologies. It uses the layout of facial features and their distance from one another for identification against a "gallery" of faces with similar characteristics. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/ibia_ntia_7-22-15_discussion_draft.pdf">Privacy Best Practice Recommendations For Commercial Biometric Use, NTIA Discussion Draft (July 22, 2015), p. 1</a>.
    *   The ability of facial recognition technology to identify consumers based solely on a photograph, create linkages between the offline and online world, and compile highly detailed dossiers of information, makes it especially important for companies using this technology to implement privacy by design concepts with robust choice and transparency policies. Such practices should include reducing the amount of time consumer information is retained, adopting reasonable security measures, and disclosing to consumers that the facial data collected may be used to link them to information from third-parties or publicly available sources.

*   Background
    *   The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) defines "personal information" to include identifiers, such as a customer number held in a cookie, an IP address, a processor or device serial number, or a unique device identifier that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different websites or online services, even where such an identifier is not paired with other items of personal information. Companies should disclose in their privacy policy, and in their direct notice to parents, their collection, use or disclosure practices of persistent identifiers unless: (1) the company collects no other "personal information," and (2) persistent identifiers are collected on or through a company's site or service solely for the purpose of providing "support for the internal operations" of the site or service. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions">FTC, Complying with COPPA: Frequently Asked Questions, q. 6</a>.
    *   Persistent identifiers collected for the sole purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the website or online service do not require parental consent, so long as no other personal information is collected and the persistent identifiers are not used or disclosed to contact a specific individual, including through behavioral advertising; to amass a profile on a specific individual; or for any other purpose. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions">FTC, Complying with COPPA: Frequently Asked Questions, q. 5</a>.
    *   The data on students collected and maintained by Ed Tech can be extremely sensitive, including medical histories, social and emotional assessments, progress reports, and test results. Online services also collect new types of data, which were not contemplated by and may not be protected by federal privacy laws. New data types collected by Ed Tech include "metadata," such as a student’s location, how many attempts a student made to answer a question, and whether a student is using a desktop or a mobile device. Metadata can be put to good use to personalize learning and to improve educational products. It can also be used to influence or market to students or to their parents.

D.O.J., p. 3</a>.
    *   A vendor should describe the types or categories of student information that they acquire from schools, school districts, teachers, parents, or students. Data types may include behavioral data reflecting how a student used the site or service or what content the student has accessed or created through it, and transactional data, such as persistent unique identifiers, collected through the use of your site or service. While unique identifiers are evolving with technology, currently such identifiers include, but are not limited to, cookies, device IDs, IP addresses, and other data elements if used to identify devices or users.

*   Background
    *   Establishing consumer choice as a baseline requirement for companies that collect and use consumer data, while also identifying certain practices where choice is unnecessary, is an appropriately balanced model. It increases consumers' control over the collection and use of their data, preserves the ability of companies to innovate new products and services, and sets clear expectations for consumers and industry alike. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 36</a>.
    *   There are five categories of data practices that companies can engage in without offering consumer choice, because they involve data collection and use that is either obvious from the context of the transaction or sufficiently accepted or necessary for public policy reasons. The categories include: (1) product and service fulfillment; (2) internal operations; (3) fraud prevention; (4) legal compliance and public purpose; and (5) first-party marketing.

    *   Companies should recognize the sensitivity of data and take special care to delete data as soon as possible and implement reasonable restrictions on the retention of data and dispose of it once the data has outlived the legitimate purpose for which it was collected. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), pp. 28-29</a>.
    *   The Administration encourages companies engaged in online advertising to refrain from collecting, using, or disclosing personal data that may be used to make decisions regarding employment, credit, and insurance eligibility or similar matters that may have significant adverse consequences to consumers. Collecting data for such sensitive uses is at odds with the contextually well-defined purposes of generating revenue and providing consumers with ads that they are more likely to find relevant.

## Data Sharing: Protecting data from third parties

Evaluating data sharing takes into consideration best practices that protect the disclosure of a user's personal information to third parties.


#### 3.1.1: Data Shared (BASIC)
Do the policies clearly indicate if collected information (this includes data collected via automated tracking or usage analytics) is shared with third parties?

*   Background
    *   Online educational services increasingly collect a large amount of contextual or transactional data as part of their operations, often referred to as "metadata." Metadata refer to information that provides meaning and context to other data being collected; for example, information about how long a particular student took to perform an online task has more meaning if the user knows the date and time when the student completed the activity, how many attempts the student made, and how long the student's mouse hovered over an item (potentially indicating indecision). See <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, pp. 2-3</a>.
    *   Metadata that have been stripped of all direct and indirect identifiers are not considered protected information under FERPA, because the data are not PII. A provider that has been granted access to PII from education records under the "school official" exception may use any metadata that are not linked to FERPA-protected information for other purposes, unless otherwise prohibited by the terms of their agreement with the school or district. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, pp. 2-3</a>.
    *   Companies collect a wide range of personal information from users—from personal details and account profiles to a user’s activities and location. Companies also often share this information with third parties, such as advertisers, governments, and legal authorities. We expect companies to clearly disclose what user information they share and with whom. Company disclosure should specify if it shares user information with governments and with commercial entities. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, P4.</a>

#### 3.1.2: Data Categories (BASIC)
Do the policies clearly indicate what categories of information are shared with third parties?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses the categories of information shared with third parties.
*   Citation
    *   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act: (A parent or guardian can request the operator to provide a description of the specific types or categories of personal information collected from children by the application or service) See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4939e77c77a1a1a08c1cbf905fc4b409&node=16:1.0.1.3.36&rgn=div5">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), 16 C.F.R. Part 312.6(a)(1)</a>
*   Background
    *   Consumers deserve more transparency about how their data is shared beyond the entities with which they do business directly, including "third-party" data collectors. This means ensuring that consumers are meaningfully aware of the spectrum of information collection and reuse as the number of firms that are involved in mediating their consumer experience or collecting information from them multiplies. The data services industry should follow the lead of the online advertising and credit industries and build a common website or online portal that lists companies, describes their data practices, and provides methods for consumers to better control how their information is collected and used or to opt-out of certain marketing uses. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf">Exec. Office of the President, Big Data: Seizing Opportunities, Preserving Values (2014), p. 62</a>.
    *   What is the "School Official" Exception? In some cases, providers need PII from a students's education records in order to deliver the agreed-upon services. FERPA's school official exception to consent is most likely to apply to the schools' and districts' relationships with service providers. When schools and districts outsource institutional services or functions, FERPA permits the disclosure of PII from education records to contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third-parties provided that the outside party meets specified requirements. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">34 C.F.R. § 99.31(a)(1)(i)</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/Vendor%20FAQ.pdf">PTAC, Responsibilities of Third-Party Service Providers under FERPA, P. 2</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, p. 3-5</a>.

*   Background
    *   Data while not traditionally considered personally identifiable, can be linkable to a consumer or device. Studies have demonstrated that consumers object to being tracked, regardless of whether the tracker explicitly learns a consumer name. There also exists the potential for harm, such as discriminatory pricing based on online browsing history, even without the use of PII.

*   Background
    *   A company that transfers data from one company to another should not place emphasis on the disclosures themselves, but on whether a disclosure leads to a use of personal data that is inconsistent within the context of its collection or a consumer's expressed desire to control the data. Thus, if a company transfers personal data to a third party, it remains accountable and thus should hold the recipient accountable—through contracts or other legally enforceable instruments. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo24557/privacy-final.pdf">Exec. Office of the President, Consumer Data Privacy in a Networked World: A Framework for Protecting Privacy and Promoting Innovation in the Global Digital Economy (2012), p. 22</a>.
    *   A company's data would not be "reasonably linkable" to a particular consumer or device to the extent that the company implements three significant protections for that data: (1) a given data set is not reasonably identifiable, (2) the company publicly commits not to re-identify it, and (3) the company requires any downstream users of the data to keep it in de-identified form. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 21</a>.
    *   The ability to re-identify "anonymous" data supports the FTC's framework application to data that can be reasonably linked to a consumer or device, because consumers' privacy interest in data goes beyond what is strictly labeled PII. There exists a legitimate interest for consumers in having control over how companies collect and use aggregated or de-identified data, browser fingerprints, and other types of non-PII. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), pp. 18-19</a>.
    *   Properly de-identified data can reduce the risk of a person's sensitive personal information being disclosed, but data de-identification must be done carefully. Simple removal of direct identifiers from the data to be released does not constitute adequate de-identification. Properly performed de-identification involves removing or obscuring all identifiable information until all data that can lead to individual identification have been expunged or masked. Further, when making a determination as to whether the data have been sufficiently de-identified, it is necessary to take into consideration cumulative re-identification risk from all previous data releases and other reasonably available information. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/data_deidentification_terms.pdf">PTC, Data De-identification: An Overview of Basic Terms, p. 3</a>.
    *   A vendor should contractually require their service providers who receive covered information acquired through the site or service to use the information only to provide the contracted service, not to further disclose the information, to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices as required by law, and to return or delete covered information at the completion of the contract. Include a requirement that any service providers notify the vendor immediately of any unauthorized disclosure of the student information in their custody, and then act promptly to provide proper notice as required by law. Make clear to service providers that they may separately face liability for the mishandling of student data.

## Data Security: Protecting against unauthorized access

Evaluating data security takes into consideration best practices that protect the integrity and confidentiality of a user's data.


#### 8.1.1: Verify Identity
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not the vendor or vendor-authorized third party verifies a user's identity with personal information?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses users are required to verify their identity with a government issued identification or with other forms of identification that could be connected to their offline identity.
    *   Discloses users are required to verify their identity with personal information for parental consent purposes.
*   Citation
    *   Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act: (An educational institution is required to use reasonable methods to verify the identity of a parent of a child with whom they disclose information) See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 34 C.F.R.

    *   General Data Protection Regulation: (Where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request ... the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.) See <a target="_blank" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Transparent information, communication and modalities for the exercise of the rights of the data subject, Art. 12(6)</a>
*   Background
    *   The ability to communicate anonymously is essential to freedom of expression both on and offline. The use of a real name online, or requiring users to provide a company with identifying information, provides a link between online activities and a specific person. This presents human rights risks to those who, for example, voice opinions that don't align with a government's views or who engage in activism that a government does not permit. It also presents risks for people who are persecuted for religious beliefs or sexual orientation. We therefore expect companies to disclose whether they might ask users to verify their identities using government-issued ID or other forms of identification that could be connected to their offline identity. We acknowledge that users may have to provide information that could be connected to their offline identity in order to access paid features of various products and services. However, users should be able to access features that don't require payment without needing to provide information that can be tied to their offline identity.

*   Background
    *   A vendor should provide a general description of the technical, administrative and physical safeguards you use to protect student information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 14</a>.
    *   A vendor should implement and maintain reasonable security measures appropriate to the nature of the student information, including covered information, acquired through your site or service. Designate and train someone responsible and use a risk management process: identify your data assets, assess threats and vulnerabilities, apply appropriate controls, monitor their effectiveness, and repeat the process. As discussed in the California Data Breach Report, the Center for Internet Security’s Critical Security Controls is a good starting point for high-priority security controls. The Federal Trade Commission’s Start with Security also offers helpful guidance. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 15</a>.
    *   This indicator is applicable to internet and mobile ecosystem companies. Companies hold significant amounts of user information, making them targets for malicious actors. We expect companies to help users protect themselves against such threats. Companies should clearly disclose that they use advanced authentication techniques to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and information. We also expect companies to provide users with tools that enable them to secure their accounts and to know when their accounts maybe compromised. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, P17.</a>

See <a target="_blank" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject, Art. 34(3)(a)-(c)</a>
*   Background
    *   The breach notification laws in California and the 46 other states are similar in many ways, because most are modeled on the original California law. All of them require notifying individuals when their personal information has been breached, prefer written notification but allow using the "substitute method" in certain situations, allow for a law enforcement delay, and provide an exemption from the requirement to notify when data is encrypted and the keys required to de-crypt the data are still secure. However, there are some differences, primarily in three areas: (1) the notification trigger, (2) the timing for notification, and (3) the definition of covered information. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/breachreport2016">CA DOJ, California Data Breach Report (2016)</a>.
    *   A vendor should develop and describe the process for notifying schools or school districts, parents, legal guardians, or eligible students, as well as any appropriate government agencies, of any unauthorized disclosure of student information. Determine whether the incident and the types of data involved also require notification under California's breach notification law, and if so, take appropriate action. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 15</a>.
    *   When the security of users' data has been compromised due to a data breach, companies should have clearly disclosed processes in place for addressing the security threat and for notifying affected users. Given that data breaches can result in significant threats to an individual's financial or personal security, in addition to exposing private information, companies should make these security processes publicly available. Individuals can then make informed decisions and consider the potential risks before signing up for a service or giving a company their information. Company press releases or blog posts addressing a data breach after it has occurred do not qualify as sufficient disclosure for this indicator. We expect companies to have formal policies in place regarding their handling of data breaches if and when they occur, and companies to make this information about these policies and commitments public. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, P15.</a>

*   Background
    *   A vendor should retain student information acquired through the site or service only as long as allowed or required by the school or district. A vendor should also describe their data retention policy, including how long they retain student information and why. A vendor's default retention period for covered information should not be indefinite. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/ready-for-school-1116.pdf">Ready for School, Recommendations for the Ed Tech Industry to Protect the Privacy of Student Data (November 2016), CA. D.O.J., p. 12</a>.
    *   Companies collect a wide range of personal information from users in exchange for the use of and access to the company's products and services. This information can range from personal details, profiles, and account activities to information about a user's activities and location. We expect companies to clearly disclose how long they retain user information and the extent to which they remove identifiers from user information they retain. Users should also be able to understand what happens when they delete their accounts. Companies that choose to retain user information for extended periods of time should take steps to ensure that data is not tied to a specific user. Acknowledging the ongoing debates about the efficacy of de-identification processes, and the growing sophistication around re-identification practices, we still consider de-identification a positive step that companies can take to protect the privacy of their users. If companies collect multiple types of information, we expect them to provide detail on how they handle each type of information. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, P6.</a>

## Individual Control: Controlling data use

Responsible data use practices limit how personal information is used to only what's necessary to provide the application or service and user controls allow data practices to change.

#### 5.4.1: User Control
Do the policies clearly indicate whether or not a user can control the vendor or third party's use of their information through privacy settings?
*   Indicator
    *   Discloses how users can control the collection, use, or disclosure of their information.
*   Background
    *   While notice and consent remains fundamental in many contexts, it is important to examine whether a greater focus on how data is used and reused would be a more productive basis for managing privacy rights in a big data environment. It may be that creating mechanisms for individuals to participate in the use and distribution of his or her information after it is collected is actually a better and more empowering way to allow people to access the benefits that derive from their information. Privacy protections must also evolve in a way that accommodates the social good that can come of big data use. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf">Exec. Office of the President, Big Data: Seizing Opportunities, Preserving Values (2014), p. 61</a>.

*   Background
    *   The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") encourages companies that collect personal information that is inconsistent with the context of a particular transaction, or the consumer's relationship with the business, to make appropriate disclosures to consumers regarding the company's data collection practices at a relevant time and in a prominent manner – outside of a privacy policy or other legal document. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 27</a>.
    *   There may be practices that are inconsistent with the context of the interaction standard and thus warrant consumer choice. For instance, there may be contexts in which the "repurposing" of data to improve existing products or services would exceed the internal operations concept. Thus, where a product improvement involves additional sharing of consumer data with third-parties, it would no longer be an "internal operation" consistent with the context of the consumer's interaction with a company.

*   Background
    *   When data are collected in one context and combined with data from other sources or different contexts, it increases the potential for an individual's privacy to be compromised. Combining data from multiple sources is part of the process of creating a digital profile of a student. Combining data from multiple sources can also be used to re-identify data sets that have been de-identified, or to identify individuals within data sets that have been shared as anonymous aggregated data. A privacy policy that prohibits third-parties from re-identifying anonymous aggregated data provides an additional level of privacy protection for users.

*   Background
    *   Companies often set boundaries for what content users can post on a service as well as what activities users can engage in on the service. Companies can also restrict a user’s account, meaning that the user is unable to access the service, for violating these rules. For mobile ecosystems, this can include restricting access to an end-user’s account or a developer’s account. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, F3.</a>
    *   We also expect companies to clearly disclose whether they have a policy of granting priority or expedited consideration to any government authorities and/or members of private organizations or other entities that identify their organizational affiliation when they report content or users for allegedly violating the company’s rules. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018-indicators/">Ranking Digital Rights, F3.</a>
    *   This indicator focuses on whether companies clearly disclose that they notify users when they take these types of actions (whether due to terms of service enforcement or third-party restriction requests). A company's decision to restrict or remove access to content or accounts can have a significant impact on users' freedom of expression and access to information rights. We therefore expect companies to disclose that they notify users when they have removed content, restricted a user's account, or otherwise restricted users' abilities to access a service. If a company removes content that a user has posted, we expect the company to inform that user about its decision. If a different user attempts to access content that the company has restricted, we expect the company to notify that user about the content restriction. We also expect companies to specify reasons for their decisions. This disclosure should be part of companies' explanations of their content and access restriction practices.

This gives consumers a more tractable task of assessing whether to engage with a single entity, rather than trying to understand what personal data third-parties (potentially dozens, or even hundreds of entities) receive and how they use it.

See <a target="_blank" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Processing which does not require identification, Art. 11(1)</a>
*   Background
    *   There is nothing wrong with a provider using de-identified data for other purposes, because privacy statutes, govern PII, not de-identified data. But because it can be difficult to fully de-identify data, as a best practice, an agreement between a company and third-party should prohibit re-identification and any future data transfers unless the third-party also agrees not to attempt re-identification. It is also a best practice to be specific about the de-identification process. De-identification typically requires more than just removing any obvious individual identifiers, as other demographic or contextual information can often be used to re-identify specific individuals. Retaining location and school information can also greatly increase the risk of re-identification. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/TOS_Guidance_Jan%202015_0.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Model Terms of Service, P. 3</a>.
    *   Properly de-identified data can reduce the risk of a person's sensitive personal information being disclosed, but data de-identification must be done carefully. Simple removal of direct identifiers from the data to be released does not constitute adequate de-identification. Properly performed de-identification involves removing or obscuring all identifiable information until all data that can lead to individual identification have been expunged or masked. Further, when making a determination as to whether the data have been sufficiently de-identified, it is necessary to take into consideration cumulative re-identification risk from all previous data releases and other reasonably available information.

    *   FERPA allows properly de-identified data to be used for other purposes, though providers planning to use de-identified student data should be clear about their methodologies for de-identification. If de-identified data will be transferred to another party, it is a best practice to contractually prohibit the third-party from attempting to re-identify any student data. Providers should also acknowledge whether anonymized metadata—a type of deidentified or partially de-identified data—will be used, and for what purposes.

*   Background
    *   While data shared in the aggregate can reduce the risk of re-identifying anonymous individuals, it does not completely eliminate the risk, and sharing of aggregate data should be carefully reviewed. The aggregation of student-level data into school-level (or higher) reports removes much of the risk of disclosure, since no direct identifiers (such as a name, Social Security Number, or student ID) are present in the aggregated tables. Some risk of disclosure does remain, however, in circumstances where one or more students possess a unique or uncommon characteristic (or a combination of characteristics) that would allow them to be identified in the data table (this commonly occurs with small ethnic subgroup populations), or where some easily observable characteristic corresponds to an unrelated category in the data table (e.g., if a school reports that 100% of males in grade 11 scored at "Below Proficient" on an assessment). In these cases, some level of disclosure avoidance is necessary to prevent disclosure in the aggregate data table. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/FAQs_disclosure_avoidance.pdf">PTAC, Frequently Asked Questions—Disclosure Avoidance (Oct 2012), p. 2</a>.

    *   A company must take reasonable measures to ensure that the data is de-identified. This means that the company must achieve a reasonable level of justified confidence that the data cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular consumer, computer, or other device.

    *   Anonymous data is 'data that is in no way connected to another piece of information that could enable a user to be identified.' This expansive view is necessary to reflect several facts. First, skilled analysts can de-anonymize large data sets. This renders nearly all promises of anonymization unattainable. In essence, any data tied to an 'anonymous identifier' is not anonymous; rather, this is often pseudonymous data that may be tied back to the user’s offline identity. Second, metadata maybe as or more revealing of a user's associations and interests than content data, thus this data is of vital interest. Third, entities that have access to many sources of data, such as data brokers and governments, may be able to pair two or more data sources to reveal information about users. Thus, sophisticated actors can use data that seems anonymous to construct a larger picture of a user.

*   Citation
    *   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act: (An operator must take reasonable steps to release a child's personal information only to service providers and third parties who are capable of maintaining the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the information, and provide assurances that they contractually maintain the information in the same manner) See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4939e77c77a1a1a08c1cbf905fc4b409&node=16:1.0.1.3.36&rgn=div5">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), 16 C.F.R. Part 312.8</a>
*   Background
    *   When data are collected in one context and combined with data from other sources or different contexts, it increases the potential for an individual's privacy to be compromised. Combining data from multiple sources is part of the process of creating a digital profile of a student. Combining data from multiple sources can also be used to re-identify data sets that have been de-identified, or to identify individuals within data sets that have been shared as anonymous aggregated data. A privacy policy that prohibits third-parties from re-identifying anonymous aggregated data provides an additional level of privacy protection for users. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/data_deidentification_terms.pdf">PTC, Data De-identification: An Overview of Basic Terms</a>.
    *   The FTC recommends that third-party data brokers take reasonable precautions to ensure that downstream users of their data do not use it for eligibility determinations or for unlawful discriminatory purposes. Of course, the use of race, color, religion, and certain other categories to make credit, insurance, and employment decisions is already against the law, but data brokers should help ensure that the information does not unintentionally go to unscrupulous entities that would be likely to use it for unlawful discriminatory purposes. Similarly, data brokers should conduct due diligence to ensure that data that they intend for marketing or risk mitigation purposes is not used to deny consumers credit, insurance, employment, or the like. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/data-brokers-call-transparency-accountability-report-federal-trade-commission-may-2014/140527databrokerreport.pdf">FTC, Data Brokers: A Call For Transparency and Accountability (May 2014), pp. 55-56</a>.
    *   A company that transfers data from one company to another should not place emphasis on the disclosures themselves, but on whether a disclosure leads to a use of personal data that is inconsistent within the context of its collection or a consumer's expressed desire to control the data. Thus, if a company transfers personal data to a third party, it remains accountable and thus should hold the recipient accountable—through contracts or other legally enforceable instruments. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo24557/privacy-final.pdf">Exec. Office of the President, Consumer Data Privacy in a Networked World: A Framework for Protecting Privacy and Promoting Innovation in the Global Digital Economy (2012), p. 22</a>.
    *   The FTC's framework application applies to data that, while not yet linked to a particular consumer, computer, or device, may reasonably become so. There is significant evidence demonstrating that technological advances and the ability to combine disparate pieces of data can lead to identification of a consumer, computer, or device even if the individual pieces of data do not constitute PII. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 20</a>.

*   Background
    *   The FTC agrees that the defintion of first-party marketing should include the practice of contacting consumers across different channels. Regardless of the particular means of contact, receipt of a message from a company with which a consumer has interacted directly is likely to be consistent with the consumer's relationship with that company. If an offline or online retailer tracks a customer's activities on a third-party website, this is unlikely to be consistent with the customer's relationship with the retailer; thus, choice should be required.

B.&P. Code § 22584(b)(1)(A)</a>
*   Background
    *   Online behavioral or targeted advertising is the practice of collecting information about consumers' online interests in order to deliver targeted advertising to them. This system of advertising revolves around ad networks that can track individual consumers—or at least their devices—across different websites. When organized according to unique identifiers, this data can provide a potentially wide-ranging view of individual use of the Internet. These individual behavioral profiles allow advertisers to target ads based on inferences about individual interests, as revealed by Internet use. Targeted ads are generally more valuable and efficient than purely contextual ads and provide revenue that supports an array of free online content and services. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo24557/privacy-final.pdf">Exec. Office of the President, Consumer Data Privacy in a Networked World: A Framework for Protecting Privacy and Promoting Innovation in the Global Digital Economy (2012), pp. 11-12</a>.
    *   The FTC recommends that affirmative express consent is appropriate when a company uses sensitive data for any marketing, whether first or third-party. When health or children's information is involved, for example, the likelihood that data misuse could lead to embarrassment, discrimination, or other harms is increased. This risk exists regardless of whether the entity collecting and using the data is a first-party or a third-party that is unknown to the consumer. In light of the heightened privacy risks associated with sensitive data, first parties should provide a consumer choice mechanism at the time of data collection. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 47</a>.
    *   The FTC believes affirmative express consent for first-party marketing using sensitive data should be limited. Certainly, where a company's business model is designed to target consumers based on sensitive data – including data about children, financial and health information, Social Security numbers, and certain geolocation data – the company should seek affirmative express consent before collecting the data from those consumers. On the other hand, the risks to consumers may not justify the potential burdens on general audience businesses that incidentally collect and use sensitive information. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), pp. 47-48</a>.
    *   If a vendor displays targeted advertising they should not use any information, including covered information and persistent unique identifiers, acquired through the site or service as a basis for targeting advertising to a specific student or other user. This includes both advertising delivered on the site or service that acquired the information and advertising delivered on any other site or service based on that information.

*   Background
    *   Companies should improve the transparency of their advertising practices by disclosing that they engage in data enhancement and educate consumers about the practice, identifying the third-party sources of the data, and providing a link or other contact information so the consumer can contact the third-party source directly. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf">FTC, Protecting Consumer Privacy in an era of rapid change: recommendations for business and policy makers (2012), p. 44</a>.
    *   The FTC recommends that to further protect consumer privacy, first-parties that obtain marketing data for enhancement should take steps to encourage their third-party data broker sources to increase their own transparency, including by participating in a centralized data broker website, where consumers could learn more information about data brokers and exercise choice.

Part 312.2</a>
*   Background
    *   The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires a privacy policy to list the kinds of personal information collected from children (for example, name, address, email address, hobbies, etc.), how the information is collected, and how the company uses the personal information. It also requires companies to indicate whether they disclose information collected from children to third-parties. If so, the company must also disclose the kinds of businesses in which the third-parties are engaged, the general purposes for which the information is used, and whether the third-parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality and security of the information. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-91">15 U.S.C. § 6502</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4939e77c77a1a1a08c1cbf905fc4b409&node=16:1.0.1.3.36&rgn=div5">16 C.F.R. Part 312</a>.
    *   If a company knows that a user of the online website or service is under the age of 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) will impose more stringent requirements on the collection of information from those users. COPPA requires that operators seeking to collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13, must first obtain verifiable parental consent. Even where a user is 13 or older, COPPA remains a source of best practices for companies that collect personal information from users, particularly when those users are still minors. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-91">15 U.S.C. §§ 6501-6506</a>;<a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4939e77c77a1a1a08c1cbf905fc4b409&node=16:1.0.1.3.36&rgn=div5">16 C.F.R. Part 312</a>.
    *   COPPA permits the collection of limited personal information from children under 13 for the purposes of: (1) Obtaining verified parental consent; (2) providing parents with a right to opt-out of an operator's use of a child's email address for multiple contacts of the child; and (3) to protect a child's safety on a website or online service.

*   Background
    *   The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires an operator to post a link to a notice of its information practices on the homepage of its web site or online service and in each area of its web site where it collects "Personal Information" from children. An operator of a general audience web site with a separate children's area must also post a link to its privacy policy on the homepage of the children's area.

Part 312</a>
    *   COPPA applies anytime an operator of a website or online service has actual knowledge that it is collects, maintains, uses, or discloses personal information from a child under 13. In these situations an operator is generally required to obtain verified parental consent.
    *   COPPA requires companies to establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information collected from children. Companies should minimize what they collect in the first place and take reasonable steps to release personal information only to service providers and third-parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality, security, and integrity. Always obtain assurances that third-parties will live up to their contractual privacy responsibilities. Also, companies should hold on to personal information only as long as is reasonably necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. They should securely dispose of it once they no longer have a legitimate reason for retaining it.

*   Background
    *   The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), provides parents of students the right to access their children's Student Data or education records, and Students 18 years of age and older the right to access their own education records. In addition, FERPA provides the right to have the records amended, and the right to have some control over the disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) in the education records. Furthermore, strict storage guidelines surround Student Data which require organizations to maintain accurate, and up-to-date records. See <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1232g">20 U.S.C. § 1232g</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">34 C.F.R.

    *   What are Education Records? FERPA defines educational records as records that are: (1) directly related to a student; and (2) maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution. These records include, but are not limited to, transcripts, class lists, student course schedules, health records, student financial information, and student disciplinary records. It is important to note that any of these records maintained by a third-party acting on behalf of a school or district are also considered education records. <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1232g">20 U.S.C. § 1232g (a)(4)(A)</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">34 CFR § 99.3</a>; See <a target="_blank" href="https:://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/Vendor%20FAQ.pdf">PTAC, Responsibilities of Third-Party Service Providers under FERPA, p. 1</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, p. 2</a>.

    *   FERPA is a Federal law that protects personally identifiable information in students' education records from unauthorized disclosure. It affords parents the right to access their child's education records, the right to seek to have the records amended, and the right to have some control over the disclosure of personally identifiable information from the education records. When a student turns 18 or enters a postsecondary institution at any age, the rights under FERPA transfer from the parents to the student ("eligible student"). <a target="_blank" href="https:://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1232g">20 U.S.C. § 1232g</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">34 C.F.R.

*   Background
    *   What is the "School Official" Exception? In some cases, providers need PII from a students's education records in order to deliver the agreed-upon services. FERPA's school official exception to consent is most likely to apply to the schools' and districts' relationships with service providers. When schools and districts outsource institutional services or functions, FERPA permits the disclosure of PII from education records to contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third-parties provided that the outside party meets specified requirements. See <a target="_blank" href="http:://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=34:1.1.1.1.33">34 C.F.R. § 99.31(a)(1)(i)</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/Vendor%20FAQ.pdf">PTAC, Responsibilities of Third-Party Service Providers under FERPA, P. 2</a>; See also <a target="_blank" href="https:://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf">PTAC, Protecting Student Privacy While Using Online Educational Services: Requirements and Best Practices, p. 3-5</a>.

*   Background
    *   Where a school has contracted with an operator to collect personal information from students for the use and benefit of the school, and for no other commercial purpose, the operator is not required to obtain consent directly from parents, and can presume that the school’s authorization for the collection of students’ personal information is based upon the school having obtained the parents’ consent . . . As a best practice, the school should consider providing parents with a notice of the websites and online services whose collection it has consented to on behalf of the parent. Schools can identify, for example, sites and services that have been approved for use district-wide or for the particular school.
